# The-Effectiveness-of-Medicaid-Coverage-on-Increasing-Emergency-Department-Usage
This analysis was aimed at replicating the results of Taubman et al (2014) regarding the causal effect of Medicaid coverage on emergency-department use via the instrumental variable lottery selection, conditioned on the number of people in the household. After conducting a series of balance check, weak instrument test, and 2SLS model fitting, this analysis reached the same conclusion as the original study, which was that Medicaid coverage increased emergency-department use both in general and in specific conditions.
